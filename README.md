# Doc2Graph

Problem Statement:
The primary challenge lies in developing an effective method to convert unstructured PDF documents into structured knowledge representations. This involves parsing textual content, identifying key entities and relationships, and constructing a coherent knowledge graph that encapsulates the semantic essence of the document. Additionally, the system must facilitate efficient summarization, and accurate query answering by parsing the KG.
